SDL port of NeoPop, a portable SNK NeoGeo Pocket emulator.

For installation, you'll need SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer), see
	http://www.libsdl.org
If you want to save screenshots in PNG format, you'll need libpng, see
	http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/

You can get a list of command line options with the -h flag; the keys
are described below.

Keys
----

Movement:
   I
J     L
   K

Button A: A or SHIFT.
Button B: S or CTRL.
Option button: D or TAB.

M toggles music and sound effects during game.

1, 2, and 3 set the magnication factor: 1 is normal (160x152),
2 is doubled in both directions, 3 tripled (bigger == slower).
B toggles between blocky and smooth magnification (defaults
to smooth); 2x magnification for smooth magnification (without
blur) is AdvanceMAME Scale2x, 3x is homebrewn.

F switches between full-screen and windowed mode.

+ and = increase frameskip, - decreases frameskip. Default is one, if
the '-f' option was not used. Frameskip n means one in n frames is shown.

F3 loads and F4 writes the current emulator state from/to filename.ngs
in the current directory.

F12 saves a screenshot in the current directory.  The name of the output
file is ``neopop-ROMNAMEXXX.ext'', where ROMNAME is the internal name of
the rom and XXX is the number of the screenshot starting from 0; special
care is taken not to overwrite existing screenshots.
If the PNG library was found during compilation, screenshots are saved
as PNGs, otherwise as BMPs.

ESC quits the emulator.
