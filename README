1, 2, 3 set the magnication factor: 1 is normal (160x152),
2 is doubled in both directions, 3 tripled (bigger == slower).
M toggles between smooth and blocky magnification (defaults
to smooth); 2x magnification for smooth magnification (without
blur) is AdvanceMAME Scale2x, 3x is homebrewn.

F switches between full-screen and windowed mode.

F12 saves a screenshot in the current directory.  The name of the output
file is ``neopop-ROMNAMEXXX.png'', where ROMNAME is the internal name of
the rom and XXX is the number of the screenshot starting from 0; special
care is taken not to overwrite existing screenshots.
This feature is only enabled if the PNG library was found during compilation.

ESC quits the emulator.
