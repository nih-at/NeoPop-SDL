SDL port of NeoPop, a portable SNK NeoGeo Pocket emulator.

For installation, you'll need SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer), see
	http://www.libsdl.org/
If you want to save screenshots in PNG format, you'll need libpng, see
	http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/

You can get a list of command line options with the -h flag; details
and the keys are described in the man page.

The readme for the NeoPop is readme-core.txt; bugs-core.html contains
a known-bugs list, also from the original NeoPop source distribution.

You can find the NeoPop-SDL homepage at
