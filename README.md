SDL port of NeoPop, a portable SNK NeoGeo Pocket emulator.

Development of NeoPop-SDL has stopped.

For installation, you'll need [SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)](https://www.libsdl.org/).

If you want to save screenshots in PNG format, you'll need [libpng](http://libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html).

To read ROMs from zips, you should have [zlib](http://www.zlib.net/) installed.

You can get a list of command line options with the `-h` flag; details,
the config file, and the keys are described in the man pages
`NeoPop-SDL(6)` and `neopoprc(5)`.

You can find additional documentation in the `Documentation` directory.
The readme for the NeoPop core is [readme-core.txt](Documentation/readme-core.txt); [bugs-core.html](Documentation/bugs-core.html)
contains a known-bugs list, also from the original NeoPop source
distribution; and [recording.format.txt](Documentation/recording.format.txt) describes the save state
format NeoPop-SDL is using.

You can find the NeoPop-SDL homepage at

and an archive of the NeoPop core homepage at [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20120829133920/http://www.emuxhaven.net/~neopop/).
