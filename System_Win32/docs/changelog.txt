Alterations made to the Win32 version.
------------------------------------------------------

03 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================
- Removed the debugger executable from the binary release.
- Moved 'mute' into the common code.

04 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================
- Removed the header links between the system and core code. These
	linked sections are now unified in 'neopop.h'

06 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Optimised the graphics update, adding 6% more speed on my machine.
- Removed "system_graphics_clear" as it's surplus.

08 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Used performance timers for greater accuracy, 
	and made the caption only update every second for speed.

- I've analysed the sound-chip wave-form an it have the same bad effects
	as when NeoPop plays it back. This proves that the problems definitely
	lie in the DirectSound code, and the buffering method i've used.

- I finally think i've fixed the sound buffering, my mistake was to
	use a static block length, rather than a dynamic one. This was causing
	the sound play and write cursors to get too close causing corruption.

09 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Fixed the problem that was causing incorrect menus to be disabled when
	loading from the command line. Added new function to system_main.c 
	called: windows_load_rom which acts as a wrapper for system_load_rom
	with the extra menu manipulation added too.

- 11 and 22 khz sound don't work very well with the smaller sound buffer,
	I have decided to remove the sound frequency options and lock it to 44khz.

- Added an MRU list to the Game menu. Quite simple - but I hope it doesn't
	leak all over the place!

10 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- MRU access from the menu moves the item up the list. This allows it to
	maintain an MRU list ordered by time.

11 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Added support for multiple joysticks.

16 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Changed the MRU code again. It should ALWAYS be sorted now...

17 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Added Win32 version number to the 'about' dialog box.
- Moved default configuration to a seperate function (good idea Caz!).

18 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Added language packs for patching of the menu items, strings and dialogs.

22 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Fixed language patching of dialogs.
- Changed file format to make it easier.

27 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Added full-screen / windowed modes, use Alt-Enter to switch.
- Made optimisations to both graphics update methods.
- Added popup menu for recent files.

28 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Added link-up support! mostly contained in the 'system_comms' files.

30 AUG 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Fixed switching from full-screen mode to windowed leaving the window
in an 'always on-top' state.

04 SEP 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- In an effort to make the debugger easier to use, i've simplified the
dialog (and the code behind it) - and added a new breakpoints view. This
will allow easier expansion for multiple breakpoints and for other more
complex functionality.

- Added "run to address" mode using a special, restricted breakpoint.

05 SEP 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Added "jump to address" which sets the TLCS-900h PC to the address.

- Finished off the debugger "watch" window. The only thing that remains
is the save and load feature.

06 SEP 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Fixed a bug with translating file selector filters, the windows filter
information appended to the language section wasn't being added correctly.

- Added the implementation of the new comms function 'system_comms_poll'.

################ 1.05 RELEASE ##################

08 SEP 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Made windowed mode window height 1 pixel shorter, this was a throwback
from something else I was fiddling with and forgot to fix.

- Added some more translations to various areas.

09 SEP 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Added loads of stuff to do with the misc. dialog. 
- Added adaptoid d-pad support.
- Added a new document for direct sound, in the docs folder.

10 SEP 2002 - neopop_uk
=======================================
- Put frameskipping back in again.

- I've made sound emulation more consistant, the sound chips are only
reset when the system is, not when the sound buffers are cleared. This
makes long-term sounds (like drum patterns) remain, even over a saved state.

- Added full screen width stretching in full-screen mode.
