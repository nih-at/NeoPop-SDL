bugs:
. key parsing: SDL_GetKeyName called before SDL_SetVideoMode
. get exactly one frame's worth of DAC data each frame
. convert DAC sound ourselves (SDL is broken)
. comm: send and handle pause/unpause packets
. test comm support
. osd handling during pause sucks

regressions:
. readd smooth
. update man page (especially for config file)

features:
. osd for fullscreen, smooth
. option: yuv for fullscreen, rgb for windowed
. option: yuv only if hardware accelerated
. movie captures
. reset game
. change emulation speed (run faster/slower)
. gui
. speedup (sound, cpu)
